There is a very thin line between roasting and bullying, desclaimers don't work. Just because of a few people who platform could suffer scrutiny
We could encourage people to be sarcastic it will work like a subtext that it is a joke not a serious criticism.

A better soution is creating a balance, providing something opposite to roasting we serve the same pourpose of bringing smile to users.
The solution is adding a new narration, Users can create meme that are roasts or appreciation and because eveyone on this platform is annonymus 
it is comfortable to accept the appreciation.

we will call this second narration love. so we need to change the name of the platform to Roastandlove.
